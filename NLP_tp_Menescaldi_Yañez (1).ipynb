            "Sintesis:  Este libro es un tratado literario de filosofía epicúrea que reivindica la felicidad y ensalza el amor, la amistad, los libros, la bondad... a partir del fútbol. El narrador parte de los entrenamientos y partidos de su hijo, pero también de la pasión hacia las grandes ligas, los jugadores míticos o sus recuerdos infantiles como aficionado, con la «liturgia» que significaba ir al campo, y en cada uno de estos aspectos, en cada anécdota, en cada rememoración, abandona el fútbol para adentrarse en temas universales. Carlos Marzal va y viene, cuenta ritos de paso, escenas divertidísimas con padres que animan a sus hijos, conversaciones con otros escritores aficionados, historias sin fin que culminan en un capítulo emocionante, el del homenaje a su amigo Antonio Cabrera. El lector descubre entonces que el libro es en realidad un recorrido por la vida, y una invitación a lo mejor de ella, porque para una mirada entusiasta todo forma parte de un mismo universo.\n",

Delibes evoca su vida al hilo del recuerdo de los diferentes deportes que ha practicado. Así, a través de su pluma conocemos su temprana pasión por el fútbol, las primeras salidas al campo con su padre, la extraña relación entre amor y ciclismo, la magia intransferible de la motocicleta, su resistencia a aceptar el sistema de puntuación en el tenis, su afición por la pesca de la lubina y el cangrejo o sus chapuzones placenteros en el río o en el mar. Delibes vuelve la mirada atrás con los ojos de un niño. En prosa ajustada y transparente nos brinda unas memorias profundamente personales, llenas de nostalgia y humor, ternura y espontaneidad, que se leen con la misma fruición que sus mejores novelas.\n",

Lo recomiendo en particular a quienes son de las generaciones que alcanzaron a conectarse a internet a través de la línea telefónica.\n",
            "La narración incluye muchos datos duros, nombres reales, nicks, entidades y corporaciones, avanzando en el tiempo desde la época del telégrafo, de Graham Bell y el revolucionario teléfono, hasta llegar a 1990, con una narración ágil que a momentos presenta unos extensos paréntesis -en sentido figurado- que te llevan hacia atrás y adelante en el tiempo, saltando de un tema a otro (casi como si hoy leyeras un artículo con texto con hipervínculos que te llevaran a un tema anexo y luego a otro y otro…) y luego regresando al tema central que es la pesecución de hackers por parte de las policías y la eventual consecuencia de la defensa de la libertad y los derechos civiles en el ciberespacio.\n",

            "Género:  espiritualidad\n",
            "Sintesis:  La obra y el pensamiento de Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) han transformado el mundo de la psicología moderna. Jung fue un pensador original, pero muchas de sus ideas todavía son en gran parte desconocidas o mal comprendidas. Su contribución se extiende más allá de la teoría y la práctica de la psicología, alcanzando su influencia campos como la mitología o la historia de las religiones. En esta introducción definitiva al trabajo de Jung, el Dr. Robertson nos explica cómo el genial psicólogo suizo reintrodujo a Occidente en el mundo de los arquetipos del inconsciente colectivo, de la mitología y de los símbolos de la naturaleza. Robertson explora la estructura y la dinámica de la psique, el significado de los sueños, de la sombra, del anima, del animus, de la misteriosa figura del sí-mismo y el proceso de individuación.\n",

Pavel, que jugó en el equipo juvenil de hockey sobre hielo del Sparta Praha, narra los momentos culminantes de las carreras de estos deportistas con la pasión de quien ama el deporte, pero sin olvidar nunca su lado más cotidiano y humano, y el precio que tuvieron que pagar para alcanzar la gloria.Y es que para el autor de Cómo llegué a conocer a los peces y Carpas para la Wehrmacht, «la literatura no puede dividirse en literatura sobre bomberos o sobre deportistas. Solo hay una y, como diría Jaroslav Hasek, es literatura sobre la condición humana».\n",

Escritor uno y narrador en tanto que autor de documentales el otro, era natural que algún día pusieran en común su pasión por desplazarse y conocer los más variados paisajes físicos y humanos del planeta. El resultado es este libro escrito a cuatro manos que conforma una suerte de diálogo y un recorrido mágico y atemporal en el que se entremezclan descripciones, vivencias y aprendizaje. De trasfondo, una idea compartida: el concepto de viaje como propulsor del crecimiento personal e intelectual y elemento clave para ampliar la visión del ser humano sobre sí mismo y aquello que le rodea.\n",

A bordo del transatlántico Volendam, que los llevará hasta Nueva York, Mann escoge el Quijote como su lectura de viaje.Viaje por mar con Don Quijote es un texto en el que se mezclan inteligentes y certeras observaciones sobre la novela de Cervantes con comentarios sobre la vida cotidiana en el barco. Escrito en formato de diario personal entre el 19 y el 29 de mayo de 1934, Mann aprovecha los motivos cervantinos de la locura, el idealismo y el humor para desarrollar unas muy interesantes reflexiones sobre la situación de preguerra que se estaba empezando a gestar en su Alemania natal.\n",
